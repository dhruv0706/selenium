Welcome to the nfldb wiki! The following is a list of topics that extend 
[nfldb's API documentation](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb) with examples and 
explanation. I recommend reading the following links in the order in which they 
are listed. (The links in the reference section can be skimmed and accessed 
later when you need to look up something specific.)

If you need any help or have found a bug, please
[open a new issue on nfldb's issue 
tracker](issues/new) or join us at
our IRC channel `#nflgame` on FreeNode.
